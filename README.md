cuke-tree is a interactive web based GUI/IDE for running Cucumber tests and viewing the results.
cuke-tree scales to hundreds of cucumber tests.  It works in situations where Cucumber's
HTML reports simply can't cope with the number of test scnearios in a report.

With cuke-tree, the hierarchical, directory based structure of your feature files is
visualized as a tree structure and you can select parts of the structure to quickly execute
only the features under that part of the structure.

cuke-tree shows you the results of executing your scenarios directly in the browser and
even renders Cucumber attachments/embeddings like web page screenshots when a test fails.
